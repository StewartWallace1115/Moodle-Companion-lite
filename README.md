# Moodle-Companion-lite
This is the lite non-hosted version of this website.  Moodle Companion provides tools that are not included in the basic Moodle. These tools include a grade calculator that allows dropping grades, planning for student on what courses to take for which semester, and a mind mapping for creating a visual representation of prerequisites for certain courses.  The non-lite version is hosted on Github pages that uses Firebase on the backend as NoSQL database.
